This is my hotkey set up. It is based on TheCore hotkey layout but there are major changes.

This is designed for right handed players but keeps your hand left hand on the left side of the keyboard unlike TheCore. This layout is designed primarily for comfort but i have found it to be much faster than grid or stock.

The main profile is focused on Zerg. Protoss is also supported now.
